        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This alternative to oatmeal allows for a great start
            to your day! Quinoa, high in protein and fiber, is always
            great to cook with. Combining it with sweet blueberries and tart
            lemon creates the perfect combo!
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
            <li>2 cups nonfat milk</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon, zested</li>
            <li>1 cup blueberries</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons flax seed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Rinse quinoa in a fine strainer with cold water
                to remove bitterness until water runs clear
                and is no longer frothy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat milk in a saucepan over medium heat until
                warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir quinoa and salt into
                the milk; simmer over medium-low heat until much
                of the liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.
                Remove saucepan from heat. Stir maple syrup and
                lemon zest into the quinoa mixture. Gently fold
                blueberries into the mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide quinoa mixture between 2 bowls; top each
                with 1 teaspoon flax seed to serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
